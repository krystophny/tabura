# Native Clients

This document is the release/run/verification guide for the shipped native thin-client slice.

The repo does not claim a broader finished mobile product than what is verified here. The current shipped scope is:

- iOS thin-client transport, ink capture, audio capture, and black dialogue surface wiring
- Android thin-client transport, ink capture, foreground audio capture, and black dialogue surface wiring
- Boox detection, raw drawing, and e-ink refresh hooks inside the Android client, with hardware validation required before a release note can claim Boox readiness

Use [`native-clients-plan.md`](native-clients-plan.md) for the architecture decision and source-code anchors. Use this document for setup, run, verification, and documentation honesty.

## Setup and Run

1. Start a Slopshell server reachable from the device:

   ```bash
   TMP_ROOT="$(mktemp -d -t slopshell-native-XXXXXX)"
   WORKSPACE_DIR="$TMP_ROOT/workspace"
   DATA_DIR="$TMP_ROOT/data"
   go run ./cmd/slopshell server \
     --workspace-dir "$WORKSPACE_DIR" \
     --data-dir "$DATA_DIR" \
     --web-host 0.0.0.0 \
     --web-port 8420 \
     --mcp-socket "$TMP_ROOT/mcp.sock"
   ```

2. Fast native contract checks:

   ```bash
   npm run test:flows:ios:contract
   npm run test:flows:android:contract
   npm run test:flows:android:contract:jvm
   ```

   `npm run test:flows:android:contract:jvm` is the JVM-only subset that hosted
   CI uses; it does not require the Android SDK.

3. Full native validation:

   ```bash
   npm run test:flows:native
   ```

   This wraps [`./scripts/test-native-flows.sh`](../scripts/test-native-flows.sh).

   This command:

- refreshes the generated native flow fixtures
- runs the shared web Playwright flow suite
- runs the fast iOS and Android contract suites
- runs the Android UI harness on a local emulator
- syncs the repo to `faepmac1` and runs the iOS UI harness on a simulator there

   Environment knobs:

- `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` must point at the local Android SDK.
- `SLOPSHELL_ANDROID_AVD` chooses the Android emulator. If unset, the first local AVD is used.
- `SLOPSHELL_IOS_SSH_HOST` defaults to `faepmac1`.
- `SLOPSHELL_IOS_REMOTE_ROOT` defaults to `~/slopshell-ci` on the macOS host.
- `SLOPSHELL_IOS_DESTINATION` overrides the `xcodebuild` simulator destination string.

4. Manual app runs:

   After the automated checks pass, build and run `SlopshellIOS` or the Android app on current hardware when a PR needs human validation beyond the scripted harness.

## Automated Verification

Use these checks before claiming the native slice is working:

1. Fast native contract suites:

   ```bash
   npm run test:flows:native:contract
   ```

   This covers dialogue presentation logic, transport URL helpers, payload encoding, Boox detection heuristics, Boox/Android stroke normalization, and the shared flow contract.

   The underlying commands are:

   ```bash
   swift test --package-path platforms/ios
   ANDROID_HOME=/home/ert/android-sdk gradle -p platforms/android app:testDebugUnitTest
   gradle -p platforms/android/flow-contracts test
   ./scripts/playwright.sh
   ```

2. Release-validation path:

   ```bash
   npm run test:flows:native
   ```

   This is the required completion-evidence command for the iOS/Android thin-client slice.

3. Server/web dialogue companion wiring:

   `npm run test:flows:native` already includes the shared Playwright flow suite, so the web/native circle contract stays in one validation path.

4. Hosted CI coverage:

   `.github/workflows/test-reports.yml` runs three required jobs in parallel on
   every pull request and push to `main`:

   - `reports` (ubuntu-latest) runs the shared web flow suite via
     `npm run test:flows`.
   - `android-flow-contract` (ubuntu-latest) runs
     `npm run test:flows:android:contract:jvm`, executing the shared flows
     against the JVM/Kotlin `FlowRunner` so the Android adapter must stay green
     before merge.
   - `ios-flow-contract` (macos-latest) runs `npm run test:flows:ios:contract`,
     executing the shared flows against the Swift `FlowRunner` so the iOS
     adapter must stay green before merge.

   The simulator and emulator UI harnesses still run on the documented macOS
   host (`faepmac1`) and on a local Android emulator through
   `./scripts/test-native-flows.sh`; hosted CI cannot run those without
   dedicated mobile infrastructure.

The structural tests in `platforms/ios/project_files_test.go` and `platforms/android/project_files_test.go` are regression guards for packaging/layout. They are not completion evidence on their own.

## Manual Verification

Attach current hardware results to the PR or issue when platform hardware is involved.

1. iOS server discovery and transport

   Pass: `_slopshell._tcp` discovery finds the server or a manual URL connects, chat history loads, canvas snapshot loads, and live chat events continue after connect.

   Fail: discovery never resolves, connect succeeds without chat/canvas data, or websocket updates stop after the first turn.

2. iOS ink, audio, and dialogue surface

   Pass: ink strokes commit to the active chat session, `Black` idle surface enters the full-screen black panel, a tap starts then stops audio capture, and returning from background keeps the app responsive for the next turn.

   Fail: ink is only local, dialogue mode is only cosmetic, recording cannot be stopped cleanly, or background/foreground transition breaks the next capture cycle.

3. Android discovery, transport, ink, and foreground audio

   Pass: the Android client discovers or connects to the server, canvas/chat stay live, stylus or touch input produces `ink_stroke` messages, and the foreground microphone service starts and stops in sync with the dialogue surface.

   Fail: the client loads only static content, ink never reaches the server, or service state diverges from the UI recording state.

4. Boox raw drawing and e-ink refresh

   Pass: the Android client detects an Onyx/Boox device, uses `SlopshellBooxInkSurfaceView`, raw stylus input emits `ink_stroke` websocket messages with the same normalized stroke payload as the Android Ink path, canvas updates render with the e-ink CSS override, and refresh calls drive the Boox e-ink controller after content load.

   Fail: Boox uses the generic Android ink surface, raw strokes stay local, canvas updates ghost until a manual full refresh, or the e-ink controller hooks are not called.

## Issue 689 Evidence Matrix

Use this matrix when reviewing native-client completion claims:

| Requirement | Automated evidence | Required hardware evidence |

| iOS chat/canvas transport | `npm run test:flows:ios:contract` and `npm run test:flows:ios` | Chat history, canvas snapshot, and websocket updates observed against a live server |
| iOS ink capture | `SlopshellModelContractTests.testRequestEncodingMatchesThinClientWireFormat` | Pencil/touch stroke commits to the active chat session |
| iOS audio/background behavior | `SlopshellDialogueModeTests` and iOS UI harness | Record, stop, background, foreground, then record again without losing the next turn |
| Android discovery and chat/canvas transport | `npm run test:flows:android:contract` and `npm run test:flows:android` | Discovered or manual server connects, with live chat and canvas updates |
| Android ink capture | `SlopshellInkStrokeBuilderTest` and `SlopshellModelContractTest.requestBuildersEmitExpectedCapturePayloads` | Stylus/touch stroke emits an `ink_stroke` websocket payload |
| Android foreground audio | `SlopshellDialogueModeTest` plus Android UI harness | Foreground microphone service starts and stops in sync with the dialogue surface |
| Boox detection | `SlopshellModelContractTest.booxDetectionAcceptsManufacturerOrSdkSignals` | Current Boox hardware displays `Boox E-Ink mode active` |
| Boox raw drawing | `SlopshellInkStrokeBuilderTest` and `TestSlopshellAndroidSourcesCoverThinClientResponsibilities` | Raw stylus drawing emits normalized `ink_stroke` payloads on hardware |
| Boox e-ink refresh | `TestSlopshellAndroidSourcesCoverThinClientResponsibilities` | Canvas updates use e-ink contrast styling and refresh without persistent ghosting |
| Product-doc honesty | `npm run test:native-docs` | PR body includes the commands, excerpts, and any hardware artifact paths used for the claim |

## Documentation Honesty

Do not describe the native clients as a broader completed product unless the automated checks above pass and the manual checklist above has current hardware results attached.

The current repo claim is limited to the automated and manual evidence above. Boox code paths are present, but Boox readiness has its own closure standard in [`boox-validation.md`](boox-validation.md). Generic Android validation does not prove Boox readiness; do not reuse Android emulator or contract evidence as Boox evidence.

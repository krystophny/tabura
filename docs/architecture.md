Slopshell is a Go monolithic UI/runtime with a split listener model:
- public web/UI listener
- private local runtime/control socket

There are exactly two external agent-facing MCP servers in the sloppy stack:

- `sloppy` = `sloptools mcp-server`
- `helpy` = `helpy mcp-stdio`

`slopshell` is not an external MCP server. The local Unix-socket routes
described here are private Slopshell runtime interfaces.

Runtime stack:
- `slopshell-web.service` runs the Go monolith (`slopshell server`)
- `helpy-mcp.service` runs the private helpy runtime daemon on `unix:$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/sloppy/helpy.sock`
- `slopshell-codex-app-server.service` runs Codex app-server
- `slopshell-piper-tts.service` runs Piper TTS API on loopback
- the intent/app-assistant path uses a routed `qwen` backend (`qwen3.6-35b-a3b-q4`) over an OpenAI-compatible endpoint

## Components

- `cmd/slopshell/main.go`
  - CLI entrypoint and subcommand dispatch.
- `internal/runtimecontrol/server.go`
  - Private runtime JSON-RPC methods and tool dispatch.
- `internal/canvas/adapter.go`
  - Canvas sessions, artifact state, and event log.
- `internal/serve/app.go`
  - Private runtime socket routes (including an intentionally undocumented
    control RPC path) and canvas websocket (`/ws/canvas`) mounted on the
    Unix-socket listener.
- `internal/web/server.go`
  - Browser APIs for chat sessions, canvas APIs, and chat/canvas websocket routes on the web listener.
- `internal/extensions/host.go`
  - Legacy manifest-driven compatibility runtime pending contraction,
    replacement, or removal. Loads only `*.extension.json` manifests.
- `internal/plugins/manager.go`
  - Legacy webhook compatibility runtime pending contraction, replacement, or
    removal. Loads only legacy plugin `*.json` manifests and ignores
    `*.extension.json` files so the two retained compatibility paths stay
    distinct.
- `internal/store/store.go`
  - SQLite persistence for workspaces, artifacts, items, actors, labels, chat, and auth.
- `internal/protocol/bootstrap.go`
  - Bootstrap behavior for project-local integration files.

## Runtime Modes

- `slopshell server`: monolithic runtime (web listener + private local runtime socket)
- `slopshell bootstrap`: project-local setup for Slopshell state and agent config helpers

## Local Sidecars

- Codex app-server remains a separate local service and is consumed over `ws://127.0.0.1:8787`.
- Piper TTS remains a separate local HTTP service on `http://127.0.0.1:8424`.
- Intent LLM traffic goes through a configured OpenAI-compatible endpoint instead of a dedicated Slopshell-local llama service.
- Voxtype STT remains a separate local HTTP service on `http://127.0.0.1:8427/v1/audio/transcriptions`.
- Current Slopshell integration tracks voxtype branch `feature/single-daemon-openai-stt-api` from `https://github.com/peteonrails/voxtype`.
- Piper is intentionally not linked into the Go binary (`libpiper`) to avoid GPL-linked distribution coupling.

## UI Layout (Zen Canvas)

The browser UI is a full-viewport canvas with no visible chrome:

- **Tabula rasa**: blank white screen when no artifact is loaded.
- **Artifact mode**: document (text, image, PDF) fills the viewport.
- No toolbar, no prompt bar, no chat column. All interaction is invisible.
- **Edge panels** (hidden): top edge = workspace switcher, right edge = chat log / diagnostics. Revealed by hovering near screen edge (desktop) or swiping inward (mobile).

## Primary Data Flows

1. External agents call tools on `sloppy` or `helpy`; Slopshell itself uses its private local runtime/control socket where needed.
2. Tool dispatch in `internal/runtimecontrol/server.go` resolves into adapter operations.
3. Adapter updates session/artifact state in memory and emits events.
4. Browser consumes websocket events: responses stream into ephemeral overlay, artifacts update the canvas in place.

Chat hook flow:
1. Current code may route through legacy extension/plugin compatibility hooks.
2. New product behavior should stay in ordinary public core packages, not a new
   bundle ecosystem.
3. If any hook/API survives, it should be narrowed to explicit local
   capability-provider interop and deterministic compatibility needs.
4. Meeting-notes follow-up planning lives in public `sloppy-org/slopshell` issues only.

## Interaction Model

- **Tap/left-click** toggles voice recording. A red dot appears at the tap position.
- Pure VAD detects end-of-utterance and commits speech input.
- **Right-click** opens a floating text input at the cursor position.
- **Keyboard typing** (when nothing is focused) auto-activates text input.
- **Enter** sends the message; input is cleared.
- **Ctrl long-press** (300ms) starts push-to-talk; release stops and sends.
- **Escape** dismisses overlay/input. If nothing is open and an artifact is showing, clears to tabula rasa.
- On artifact: tap/right-click captures line context (`[Line N of "title"]`) prepended to the message.
- Responses stream as ephemeral overlays; click outside to dismiss. Document edits update the canvas in place with diff highlighting.

## Handoff Import Flow

1. Producer creates handoff payload (outside Slopshell).
2. Slopshell receives `canvas_import_handoff` with `handoff_id`.
3. Slopshell peeks/consumes producer handoff payload and renders artifact.

## Current Voice Runtime and Live Sessions

Slopshell now exposes one `Live` entry point with two policy variants:

- `Dialogue`
- `Meeting`

Both share the same browser-side live session owner, hotword pipeline, and
voice capture path. The built-in hotword target is `Computer`.

Wake-word detection runs entirely in the browser using ONNX Runtime Web:
- `melspectrogram.onnx` extracts mel features from raw audio.
- `embedding_model.onnx` produces frame-level embeddings.
- `keyword.onnx` is the active keyword classifier (16-frame input, ~1.28s detection latency).

The shared feature extractors live in `internal/web/static/vendor/openwakeword/`.
The active keyword model is installed into the runtime data directory and served as `keyword.onnx`.

Audio pipeline in `hotword.js`:
- Mic audio is downsampled to 16 kHz mono via a ScriptProcessorNode.
- Each audio frame is written to a 2-second ring buffer (32,000 samples) for pre-roll capture.
- Mel and embedding stages feed into the keyword classifier per frame.
- On wake-word detection, the app begins voice recording immediately (no intermediate listen window).

State transitions:
- **Quiet**: meeting live session is active and listening for context.
- **Paused** (black border + pause bars): a live session is active and waiting for `Computer`.
- **Recording** (red border + red dot): wake word detected or user tapped, capturing speech.
- **Listening** (blue border + pulse): dialogue follow-up window after TTS response.
- Follow-up timeout returns to **Paused** and restarts hotword monitoring.

Control surfaces:
- The web runtime uses a single floating `#slopshell-circle` for tool selection, Dialogue/Meeting activation, and the Silent toggle.
- The top edge panel is reduced to workspace navigation and runtime summary only.
- Configuration-heavy surfaces such as hotword/model/voice management live under `/manage` instead of the canvas shell.

Utterance filtering (server-side in `internal/stt/transcribe.go`):
- Whisper hallucination blocklist (13 phrases).
- Noise rejection: filler-only transcripts (<3 words), TV/radio background patterns.
- Minimum audio buffer size (1024 bytes).

## STT Sidecar

- `slopshell-stt.service` runs voxtype on loopback (`http://127.0.0.1:8427/v1/audio/transcriptions`).
- For source builds, use voxtype branch `feature/single-daemon-openai-stt-api` until this lands in an upstream release.
- Audio flows: browser WebSocket -> RAM buffer -> HTTP POST to sidecar -> transcript text returned.
- No audio is persisted to disk or database. See `docs/meeting-notes-privacy.md`.

## Trust and Access Boundaries

- Slopshell does not require direct credentials to producer systems.
- Producer endpoint authority remains outside Slopshell.
- Slopshell stores local auth/session state in SQLite under web data dir.
- Slopshell SQLite is a projection/runtime store: it may persist workspaces,
  normalized items/artifacts/actors, external bindings and drift records,
  batch/watch state, chat/canvas/runtime state, push registrations, and
  Slopshell-local auth/session records.
- `external_accounts.config_json` may store non-secret provider config such as
  usernames, hosts, file paths, credential references, sync cursors, and other
  rebuildable runtime settings, but it must never store raw passwords, tokens,
  cookies, backend session state, authorization headers, or other secret
  material.
- Synced remote artifacts must keep metadata and bounded previews only; full
  upstream mail/task bodies are not canonical Slopshell state and must be
  re-fetched from the backend when needed.
- Private runtime routes are not mounted on the web listener and stay on the private Unix socket.
- Slopshell is UI/runtime only; backend/domain authority lives in `sloptools` (`sloppy`) and `helpy`.

## Modular Core Direction

Slopshell's active direction is a single public repo with ordinary modular
packages under `internal/`. Product behavior should live in public core code,
not a private repo and not an extension/plugin bundle system.

Auth/session, media transport, queueing, persistence, privacy invariants, and
meeting-notes behavior stay in core. The legacy `internal/extensions` and
`internal/plugins` packages should be treated as transitional compatibility or
interop code rather than an expanding product surface.

If a compatibility surface remains during cleanup, it should be justified as a
small local capability boundary for deterministic external integrations such as
Helpy, not as a general SDK.

## Scope

`v0.1.5` finalizes the STT runtime transition to voxtype sidecar mode, hardens tap-to-stop behavior during transcript send, and aligns docs with the active runtime stack.

## Highlights

### STT Runtime and Packaging

- Removed remaining `whisper.cpp` setup path references from Sloppad runtime/docs.
- Renamed installer helper from `setup-whisper-stt.sh` to `setup-voxtype-stt.sh`.
- Standardized STT sidecar references to OpenAI-compatible endpoint `/v1/audio/transcriptions`.

### Voice Stop/Send Reliability

- Hardened voice lifecycle handling around stop gestures while transcript submit is pending.
- Added deterministic abort-aware submit guard so stop requests win over in-flight transcript sends.
- Verified with full end-to-end Playwright suite.

### Documentation Alignment

- Updated runtime docs to include explicit `sloppad-stt.service` voxtype sidecar usage.
- Added temporary voxtype source pin for Sloppad integrations:
  - repo: `https://github.com/peteonrails/voxtype`
  - branch: `feature/single-daemon-openai-stt-api`

### Metadata and Versioning

- Bumped runtime metadata to `v0.1.5` in release-visible version fields.

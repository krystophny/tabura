## Scope

`v0.0.5` introduces Push To Prompt voice capture backed by VoxType MCP and removes the Helpy STT provider path from Slopshell.

## Highlights

- Added `slopshell voxtype-mcp` command and local VoxType MCP server (`/mcp`, `/health`).
- Added user `systemd` unit `slopshell-voxtype-mcp.service` for always-on local bridge mode.
- Added streaming Push To Prompt web API: `POST /api/stt/push-to-prompt` with `start`, `append`, `stop`, `cancel`.
- Updated mail voice drafting flow to stream audio chunks to Push To Prompt for faster transcription turnaround.
- VoxType MCP bridge now prefers daemon-backed capture to reuse already-running `voxtype.service`.
- Kept `POST /api/mail/stt` as compatibility entrypoint, now implemented via VoxType MCP internally.
- Standardized terminology in docs/UI as **Push To Prompt**.
- Bumped runtime surface versions to `0.0.5`.

## Interface Stability Notes

- Helpy STT integration was removed from Slopshell in this release.
- Voice/STT behavior now depends on a loopback VoxType MCP endpoint.
